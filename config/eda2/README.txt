The rules are :

1/ here we keep versions of EDA2 config files with dates (not to just keep git history)
2/ instr_config_eda2.txt - is the current most up to date version of the instr_config file 
   it should also be the same in the main ~/aavs-calibration/ directory (as for now scripts look there)

   So : diff instr_config_eda2.txt ../../instr_config_eda2.txt
   should show NO DIFFERENCE
